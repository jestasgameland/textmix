House values are rising worldwide. The price of a house in London is raising eyebrows. It is 2 metres wide and is on sale for $1.3 million. This could buy you a seven-bedroom mansion elsewhere in the UK. The "skinny" house has five floors and two bedrooms. The real estate agent said: "It started life as a hat shop and was converted by a fashion photographer - the ultimate designer house....It's quirky and charming and great for entertaining." The property is 1.6 metres at its narrowest point and 8 metres long. There is a kitchen and dining room on the first floor, and a living room on the second floor. The main bedroom is on the fifth floor. Despite its cramped space, it is a one-of-a-kind design, like a luxury yacht. The agent said it "makes the most of small spaces". It is ideal for a young couple or single person. The agent said: "It is a unique part of London history. It's a bit of London magic."
