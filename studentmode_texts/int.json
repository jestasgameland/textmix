      "Second, they produce very few emissions during low speed city driving",
      "Because they do not require gas, hybrid cars reduce dependency on fossil fuels, which helps lower prices at the pump",
      "Alex bought a hybrid car two years ago and has been extremely impressed with its performance",
      "\"It's the cheapest car I've ever had,\" she said",
      "\"The running costs are far lower than previous gas-powered vehicles I've owned",
      "Given the low running costs and environmental benefits of owning a hybrid car, it is likely that many more people will follow Alex's example in the near future."
