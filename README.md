# wordmix
TextMix - An app for automating the creation of "word jumble" activities from corpora for English language learners

TO DO:

- make hover popup to explain what "start", "quickstart" and "create & share" buttons do
More educational:
- make option to leave each completed sentence up, so you can keep seeing the context and what you've previously read.
- make option to " focus on form" - only take out articles, prepositions, etc.  Add the sentence with these removed to the answerbox
- make mobile-friendly version
- make "How to play" button - loads up a createScreen with an example jumbled sentence
- Get better, more reliable source of text (not wikipedia) - other encyclopeia/text database API? use Scraper Box API or Zenscrape to get text from BreakingNewsEnglish?
- Make user guide, with glossary of all functions & variables, flow chart of what happens in each "step through" of the program
- Have spare time? Run through game and fix random bugs.
- rename app to "TextPuzzle" - get a domain name
- more fun/animation/gamification - "compose the sentences" like music - characters, etc.

Longer term:
- JSON file size limit?  Eventually move to SQL database instead
- Japanese language support (split sentences by "。" and "、" ).  But then how to split word???  (no spaces in Japanese) - could try Google Natural Language API
