TextMix - An app for automating the creation of "word jumble" and cloze activities from corpora for English language learners

RECENT UPDATES:
- added reading mode
- added cloze modes, for focusing on grammar structures or 100 most common words in English
- added explanatory popups for the different settings

TO DO:
- make mobile version
- make "How to play" button - loads up a createScreen with an example jumbled sentence
- Get better, more reliable source of text (not wikipedia) - other encyclopeia/text database API? use Scraper Box API or Zenscrape to get text from BreakingNewsEnglish?
- Make user guide, with glossary of all functions & variables, flow chart of what happens in each "step through" of the program
- Random bug fixes
- get domain name
- more fun/animation/gamification - "compose the sentences" like music, etc.

Longer term:
- JSON file size limit?  Eventually move to SQL database instead
- Japanese language support (split sentences by "。" and "、" ).  But then how to split word???  (no spaces in Japanese) - could try Google Natural Language API
